<h1 align='center'>Optimistix</h1>

Optimistix is a [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) library for nonlinear solvers: root finding, minimisation, fixed-points, and least squares.

Features include:

- TODO
- All the benefits of working with JAX: autodiff, autoparallism, GPU/TPU support etc.

## Installation

```bash
pip install optimistix
```

Requires Python 3.9+ and JAX 0.4.8+.

## Quick example

```python
