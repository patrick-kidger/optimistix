The search could not find a step size above the cutoff value, or the descent failed to 
factorise the linear system. Either is signaling that a feasibility restoration is 
required to continue. (This means solving another optimisation problem to find a close
by point in the feasible set that represents an improvement over the last point.)

This is intended to be an optimistix internal result, caught and handled by the solver.
