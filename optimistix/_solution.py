    - `value`: The solution to the solve.
    - `result`: An integer representing whether the solve was successful or not. This
        can be converted into a human-readable error message via
        `optimistix.RESULTS[result]`
    - `aux`: Any user-specified auxiliary data returned from the problem; defaults to
        `None` if there is no auxiliary data. Auxiliary outputs can be captured by
        setting a `has_aux=True` flag, e.g. `optx.root_find(fn, ..., has_aux=True)`.
    - `stats`: Statistics about the solve, e.g. the number of steps that were required.
    - `state`: The final internal state of the solver. The meaning of this is specific
        to each solver.
