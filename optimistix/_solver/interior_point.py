    allow for a relaxation of this condition, which gets tighter as the centrality

    Here is what we do: When computing an unconstrained Newton step of a quadratic
    function `x^T Hess x + grad x`, we solve for `Hess x = grad.`
    When solving a constrained quadratic program, we instead consider the Lagrangian
    `x^T Hess x + grad x - lambda * (Ax - b)`, for constraints `Ax = b`, and solve for
    both the primal and dual variables `x` and `lambda`.

    In an interior point descent, we transform inequality constraints of the form
    `Ax >= b` into equality constraints by introducing slack variables `s` such that
    `Ax - s = b`, and use these to constrain the step such that we follow a path that
    takes us through the interior of the feasible set, rather than along the boundary.
