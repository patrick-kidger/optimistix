# TODO: maybe change the name of this solver, since only the descent sticks fairly close
# to the method proposed by Coleman and Li. In particular, this solver is not a true
# trust-region method. Writing it as intended would entail computing a trust-region
# radius in the transformed space, which means that we need to either do the transform
# twice in two different places, or write a solver that applies it before handing over
# to the search. The function value itself is not transformed, and `y` would again be
# updated in the untransformed space. However, the main feature is the affine scaling,
# which angles the search direction away from the bounds. And this is what we do here.
# (I'm unconvinced that the trust region radius computed in the transformed space would
# be dramatically different from the one computed in the original space, but willing to
# convince myself otherwise with pen and paper.)
