    Supports the following `options`:

    - `autodiff_mode`: whether to use forward- or reverse-mode autodifferentiation to
        compute the gradient. Can be either `"fwd"` or `"bwd"`. Defaults to `"bwd"`,
        which is usually more efficient. Changing this can be useful when the target

    Supports the following `options`:

    - `autodiff_mode`: whether to use forward- or reverse-mode autodifferentiation to
        compute the gradient. Can be either `"fwd"` or `"bwd"`. Defaults to `"bwd"`,
