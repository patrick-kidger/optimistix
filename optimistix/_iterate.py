        See each individual solver's documentation for more details.

        solve. Keyword only argument.
    - `throw`: How to report any failures. (E.g. an iterative solver running out of
        steps, or encountering divergent iterates.) If `True` then a failure will
        raise an error. If `False` then the returned solution object will have a
        `result` field indicating whether any failures occured. (See
        [`optimistix.Solution`][].) Keyword only argument.
    - `tags`: exact meaning depends on whether this is a fixed point, root find,
