# constraints, then it might make sense to remove them, lest we confuse users.
# Possible things to do:
# - Remove bounds and constraints from the top-level API. I don't think this is great
# for maintainability since we want our solvers are interoperable and may call top-level
# APIs internally (e.g. call to `root_find` below.) This would have to be handled here
# by passing hard-coded None values to the internal calls, including `iterative_solve`.
# - Keep things as-is but add an equinox remove docs decorator. This would remove the
# keyword arguments that do not apply to fixed point solvers from the documentation. But
# they would still be part of the signature.
# - Keep things as-is and add a note to the documentation that bounds and constraints
# are not used by fixed point solvers. Perhaps throw an error if they are passed to
# `fixed_point`, or leave it as-is and handle errata in the solvers.

    """Find a fixed-point of a function.

    Given a nonlinear function `fn(y, args)` which returns a pytree of arrays of the
    same shape as `y`, this returns the value `z` such that `fn(z, args) = z`.

    **Arguments:**

    - `fn`: The function to find the fixed-point of. This should take two arguments
        `fn(y, args)`, and return a pytree of arrays of the same shape as the input `y`.
    - `solver`: The root-finder to use. This can be either an
        [`optimistix.AbstractFixedPointSolver`][] or
        [`optimistix.AbstractRootFinder`][], or
        [`optimistix.AbstractLeastSquaresSolver`][], or
        [`optimistix.AbstractMinimiser`][]. If `solver` is a root-finder then it will
        will attempt to find the root of `fn(y, args) - y`. If `solver` is a
        least-squares or minimisation algorithm, then it will attempt to minimise
        `sum((fn(y, args) - y)^2)`.
    - `y0`: An initial guess for what `y` may be. Used to start the iterative process of
        finding the fixed point; using good initial guesses is often important.
    - `args`: Passed as the `args` of `fn(y, args)`.
    - `options`: Individual solvers may accept additional runtime arguments.
        See each individual solver's documentation for more details.
    - `has_aux`: If `True`, then `fn` may return a pair, where the first element is its
        function value, and the second is just auxiliary data. Keyword only argument.
    - `constraint`: Individual solvers may accept a constraint function `constraint(y)`.
        This must return a PyTree of scalars, one for each constraint, such that
        `constraint(y) >= 0` if the constraint is satisfied. The initial value `y0` must
        be feasible with respect to these constraints. Keyword only argument.
    - `bounds`: Individual solvers may accept bounds. This should be a pair of pytrees
        of the same structure as `y`, where the first element is the lower bound, and
        the second is the upper bound. Unbounded leaves can be indicated with +/- inf
        for the upper and lower bounds, respectively. For finite bounds, it is checked
        whether `y` is in the closed interval `[lower, upper]`. Keyword only argument.
    - `max_steps`: The maximum number of steps the solver can take. Keyword only
        argument.
    - `adjoint`: The adjoint method used to compute gradients through the fixed-point
        solve. Keyword only argument.
    - `throw`: How to report any failures. (E.g. an iterative solver running out of
        steps, or encountering divergent iterates.) If `True` then a failure will raise
        an error. If `False` then the returned solution object will have a `result`
        field indicating whether any failures occured. (See [`optimistix.Solution`][].)
        Keyword only argument.
    - `tags`: Lineax [tags](https://docs.kidger.site/lineax/api/tags/) describing
        any structure of the Jacobian of `y -> fn(y, args) - y` with respect to y. (That
        is, the structure of the matrix `dfn/dy - I`.) Used with
        [`optimistix.ImplicitAdjoint`][] to implement the implicit function theorem as
        efficiently as possible. Keyword only argument.

    **Returns:**

    An [`optimistix.Solution`][] object.
