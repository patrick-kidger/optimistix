        Selecting which steps at which to save checkpoints (and when this is done, which
        old checkpoint to evict) is important for minimising the amount of recomputation
        performed.

        The implementation here performs "online checkpointing", as the number of steps
        is not known in advance. This was developed in:

    checkpoints. (So it makes sense to set as many checkpoints as you have memory for.)
