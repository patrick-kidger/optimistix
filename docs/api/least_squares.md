# Least squares

::: optimistix.least_squares

[`optimistix.least_squares`][] supports any of the following least squares solvers.

!!! info

    In addition to the solvers listed here, any [minimiser](./minimise.md) may also be used as the `solver`. This is because a least squares problem $\arg\min_\theta \sum_{i=1}^N r_i(\theta)^2$ is a special case of general minimisation problems. If you pass in a minimiser, then Optimistix will automatically treate your problem in this way.
