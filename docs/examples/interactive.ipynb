    "# Interactively step through a solve\n",

    "Sometimes you might want to perform an optimisation just one step at a time (or a few steps at a time), and perhaps do some other computations in between. A common example is when training a neural network, and looking to continually monitor performance of the model on a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is to repeatedly call e.g. `optx.minimise(..., throw=False, max_steps=1)`. However if that seems inelegant/inefficient to you, then it is possible to use the solvers yourself directly.\n",
